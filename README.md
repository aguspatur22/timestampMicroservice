# Time API Project

This project is a simple Node.js application using Express to serve an API that returns the current time or the time corresponding to a provided date in both UNIX timestamp and UTC format.

## Features

- **Current Time**: Accessing the `/api` endpoint returns the current time.
- **Specific Time**: Providing a specific date in the URL as `/api/:date` returns the time for that date.
